                Played a key role in developing and enhancing the web platform
                for an intercity travel company, improving connectivity for
                travelers across cities. Collaborating closely with product and
                design teams, I ensured a seamless, high-performance user
                experience. By implementing modern web technologies, I optimized
                platform performance and enhanced customer interactions,
                focusing on an intuitive and accessible booking-to-travel
                journey.
